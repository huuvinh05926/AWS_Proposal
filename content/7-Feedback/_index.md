### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The environment at FCJ is very dynamic and open. The work atmosphere is professional yet not restrictive. Team members always maintain a positive attitude, ready to share and support each other regardless of time. The workspace is well-organized and inspires creativity. However, if there were more regular bonding activities, the connection between members would be even stronger.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
I highly appreciate the dedication of the Mentor and Admin team. Mentors not only provide technical guidance but also cultivate a problem-solving mindset, encouraging me to explore solutions before offering suggestions, which helps me retain knowledge longer and understand more deeply. The Admin team closely follows up and provides timely support with procedures and resources, ensuring the internship process runs smoothly.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The internship content closely aligns with the foundational knowledge I learned at university, while expanding into many technologies and practical processes that textbooks haven't yet covered. This was a great opportunity to systematize my knowledge and fill gaps in practical experience.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
Beyond professional knowledge, I significantly improved soft skills such as: time management, teamwork, and communication in a corporate environment. Being exposed to standardized work processes (such as Agile/Scrum or project management workflows) is valuable preparation for future work.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The "Supportive" culture impressed me most. Everyone treats each other with respect and a constructive spirit. Even as an intern, I felt my voice and contributions were recognized. The team's spirit of "work hard, play hard" also helps reduce pressure during peak periods.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company's support policies are quite good and transparent. The internship allowance is reasonable, and especially the time flexibility helps students easily balance their studies. Internal sharing/training sessions are also a valuable "knowledge benefit."

### Additional Questions

**What did you find most satisfying during your internship?**

What I found most satisfying was the growth in my work mindset. From only knowing how to follow instructions, I learned to proactively analyze problems and seek solutions. Additionally, the enthusiasm of the Mentors helped me overcome initial uncertainties.

**What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**

Overall, the process is already quite good. I only suggest the program could add a list of reference materials (reading list) or a more detailed learning roadmap from the first week so new interns can proactively study before entering real projects.

**If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not?**

Absolutely yes. This is an ideal environment for those who want to experience real-world pressure while still receiving attentive guidance. FCJ not only teaches skills but also instills professional work attitudes and practices.

### Suggestions & Expectations

**Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?**

I suggest adding regular "1-1 Review" sessions every 2 weeks so interns can receive more detailed feedback on their strengths and weaknesses, allowing timely adjustments during the internship.

**Would you like to continue this program in the future?**

Given the value received, I very much hope to have the opportunity to continue or become a full-time employee if I meet the company's requirements.

Thank you to the FCJ team for creating a valuable playground and memorable experience during my student life. I wish the program continues to grow and welcome many more generations of talented interns!!
