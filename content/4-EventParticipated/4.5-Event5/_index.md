# AWS GameDay - Agentic AI GenAI Builder Club

### 🚀 Event Overview

On **November 21, 2025**, I participated in **AWS GameDay - Agentic AI GenAI Builder Club** organized by AWS. This was a highly competitive event where teams had to demonstrate their skills in **developing and deploying** solutions using **Generative AI** technology on the AWS platform.

The event revolved around building and optimizing **AI Agents** to handle a series of requirements and test cases.

### 💻 Main Tasks

Teams were provided with an initial code environment, and the mission was to:

1. **Develop with Python:** Use Python to write logic for AI Agents.
2. **Deploy Code:** Continuously deploy modified code to the AWS environment so that test cases automatically run and score.
3. **Debug and Optimize:** Based on scores and feedback from the system, quickly debug and optimize Agents to pass increasingly complex test cases.
4. **Scoring:** Points are awarded when Agents successfully pass cases.

### 🏆 Team Achievement: Spectacular Comeback

Our team participated and achieved an impressive result: **Third Place** overall!

- **Final Score:** **269,000 points**.
- **Most Notable Moment:** The final 15 minutes of the competition. Throughout the early period, our team only achieved around **64,000 points** and was outside the Top 10. However, by discovering the **core logic** to handle a critical series of test cases, we quickly deployed the solution and our score skyrocketed to **269,000 points**, securing a **Top 3** finish overall.

This was an excellent experience, not only technically (Python, Deploy, AWS GenAI) but also in teamwork and handling time pressure.
