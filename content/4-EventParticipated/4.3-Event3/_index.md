# DevOps Mindset

## Speaker Information

- **Truong Quang Tinh** - AWS Community Builder, Platform Engineer at TymeX

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is not just a job position or a set of tools, but a **culture and mindset** in software development. A DevOps engineer is someone who understands both the Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) worlds, acting as a **bridge** between these two sides to create a more efficient software development and deployment process.

Before DevOps, common issues included:

- Developers wrote code and "threw it over the wall" to Ops
- Ops faced deployment issues but didn't understand the code
- Slow release cycles with many errors
- Lack of communication and mutual understanding

DevOps was created to **break down these barriers**, creating a continuous and collaborative process.

## DevOps Culture - Cultural Elements

![DevOps Culture Elements](/images/4-EventParticipated/FD92568D-E9BF-49E6-B2A7-43BA1959F3E3.jpeg)

### 1. Collaboration

- Break down boundaries between teams
- Shared responsibility for products
- Cross-functional teams

### 2. Automation

- Maximize process automation
- Minimize human errors
- Code can be reviewed, tested, rolled back

### 3. Monitoring & Measurement

- Must have systems for evaluation and monitoring
- Collect metrics for data-driven decisions
- Timely alerts when issues arise

### 4. Continuous Learning

- Learn from mistakes, no blaming
- Share knowledge within team
- Encourage experimentation

### 5. Tooling

- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub, GitLab
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions
- **IaC**: Ansible, Terraform
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch

## Next-Generation DevOps

DevOps is evolving with new trends:

- **Platform Engineering**: Building Internal Developer Platform (IDP), self-service for developers
- **GitOps**: Git as single source of truth, declarative infrastructure
- **AIOps**: AI/ML in monitoring, predicting issues, automated remediation
- **DevSecOps**: Shift left security, automated security testing

## Comparing Roles

| Role                  | Focus                                  | Key Skills                                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cloud Engineer**    | Design & manage cloud infrastructure   | AWS/Azure/GCP, networking, security              |
| **DevOps Engineer**   | Automate CI/CD, bridge Dev-Ops         | Scripting, CI/CD tools, containerization, IaC    |
| **SRE**               | Reliability, availability, performance | Programming, monitoring, incident response       |
| **Platform Engineer** | Build internal platform                | Infrastructure, developer experience, API design |
