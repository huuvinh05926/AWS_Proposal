### Areas for Improvement

**Enhance Discipline and Compliance:**  
Need to be more serious in adhering to regulations, schedules, and standard company procedures to build a professional work ethic.

**Develop In-depth Problem-Solving Thinking:**  
Rather than just stopping at temporary troubleshooting, need to cultivate the habit of root cause analysis to provide optimal and long-term solutions.

**Perfect Communication and Interpersonal Skills:**  
Need to learn to communicate more tactfully and sensitively in daily situations and enhance emotional intelligence (EQ) to coordinate more harmoniously with colleagues.
